    <h1 style=¨text align:center¨ class=¨title¨> The consoles</h1>
    <p> If you are not a person who plays games and consoles frequently
    there is such a thing called the console wars. These wars have been going on for quite some time. 
    Although they have ended recently, I bet there is still multiple people that will still say 
    that one console is better then the other. Personally I think the xbox is good because I have 
    always been with it, im hoping to have the new PS5 for the new spiderman game.</p>

        </div>
    <p> There is also the people that play on PC and nintendo switch. For the PC people the console players usally 
    hate them, but most of the time we are just jealous of how we can´t get a PC. There is also the nintendo players,
    which are a special case, because if they play nintendo games like Smash Bros or Mario Kart with their friends they
    are most likely going to be cool people. Although if they try to play other games on it like mainstream games for example
    Fortnite or Call Of Duty, you can really be mad at them if they suck at it. that is because the nintendo switch controller 
    for anything other then nintendo games kinda suck.<p>
