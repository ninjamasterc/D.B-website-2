          If you are not a person who plays games and consoles frequently there
          is such a thing called the console wars. These wars have been going on
          for quite some time. Although they have ended recently, I bet there is
          still multiple people that will still say that one console is better
          then the other. Personally I think the xbox is good because I have
          always been with it, im hoping to have the new PS5 for the new
          spiderman game.

          There is also the people that play on PC and nintendo switch. For the
          PC people the console players usally hate them, but most of the time
          we are just jealous of how we can´t get a PC. There is also the
          nintendo players, which are a special case, because if they play
          nintendo games like Smash Bros or Mario Kart with their friends they
          are most likely going to be cool people. Although if they try to play
          other games on it like mainstream games for example Fortnite or Call
          Of Duty, you can´t really be mad at them if they suck at it. that is
          because the nintendo switch controller for anything other then
          nintendo games kinda suck.
